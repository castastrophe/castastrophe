### Front-end architecture

ðŸ‘‹ I am a front-end developer and architect of enterprise-scale design systems for Red Hat.  My primary focus right now is the [<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patternfly/patternfly-elements/master/favicon.ico" height="12" width="12"/>PatternFly Elements](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-elements) project; a community implementation of the PatternFly design system using web components.

I am deeply passionate about web components, the evolution of CSS, and the normalization of accessibility in the web development community.
